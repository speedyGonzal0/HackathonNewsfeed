# Hackathon Newsfeed
The client folder contains code for the frontend(Done with React). The server folder contains backend(Done with Node).


<b>Run the client file with `npm start`</b>


<b>Run the server file with `node index.js`</b>


The project is incomplete as we had limited time and a ton of coursework.
However, functionalities that work are:
1. Register as a new user with the register button and view them in the database.
2. By manually setting currentUser to true from the App.js file, you can view the 'Write' and 'Settings' options on the Navbar which links to those pages.
3. Write posts which are then stored and viewable only in the database.

Those are all we managed to do. But will continue working on the project even after the judgment phase.
